Chardow. pronounced /tcha-dau/

UI deconstruction for developers who are tired of the Inspector.

The Backstory

Honestly, I was just tired. Tired of digging through nested div soup in the Chrome Inspector, and tired of trying to guess how someone made a sick ass element.

I once saw this one specific element on a website that honestly looked incredible, and when I tried to figure out how they did it, I realized the DOM was such a nightmare that it was basically impossible to replicate quickly.

So, I built Chardow. 

It is the tool I alwasys wanted and now hoping it helps someone out there.

Features
- Deep Deconstruction: Select any box and Chardow walks the entire tree, translating everything into a nested React component.
- Heuristic Noise Reduction: It filters out browser defaults so the code looks hand-written, not scraped.
- Logic Inference: It sees a button or an input and suggests the React hooks and event handlers you actually need.
- Unified Asset Engine: Download SVGs and images with one click directly from the extraction panel.
- Premium Charcoal Aesthetic: A multi-layered dark UI that won't blast your eyes out at 3 AM.

Getting Started

1. Clone this repo.
2. Run npm install and npm run build.
3. Load the dist folder as an unpacked extension in Chrome.
4. Hit Alt + S on any site and start deconstructing.

Built for developers, by someone who was just done with inspect element.
